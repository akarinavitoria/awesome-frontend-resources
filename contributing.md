# Contribution Guidelines [WIP]

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- Include only Free Resources.
- We aim to keep the document easy to scan and easy to consume, so make extra effort to put the resource under relevent category and update the TOC.
- Headings should be in title case.
- Update Contents Section if you have added a main heading.


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one.
